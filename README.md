# GradientMaker
This is a program i have been working on since 2016 in my free time, right now im on version 4.2.1

Shoutout to ThePhisics101 for help on the GUI version 

Change Log:
4.2.1: Changed the gradient formula to allow for more shape types (allows percentage inputs)
4.2.0: rewrote the UI code to be more efficient
